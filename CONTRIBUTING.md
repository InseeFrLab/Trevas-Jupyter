## Creating a pull request

Pull requests have to come from branch prefixed by `feature/` or `fix/`.

Ideally, pull requests contain a reference to a previously filled [Trevas Jupyter issue](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/Trevas-Jupyter/issues).

Your submissions must be targeted at the `develop` branch of the [main Trevas Jupyter repository](https://github.com/InseeFrLab/Trevas-Jupyter).
